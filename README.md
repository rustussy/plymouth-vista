# PlymouthVista
Re-creation of Windows Vista and Windows 7 boot screens and shutdown screens from their original assets. Designed to be used with [VistaThemePlasma](https://gitgud.io/catpswin56/vistathemeplasma) and [AeroThemePlasma](https://gitgud.io/wackyideas/AeroThemePlasma).

Special thanks to [blacklightpy](https://github.com/blacklightpy) for the Vista boot screen code.

Special thanks to [catpswin56](https://gitgud.io/catpswin56) for VTP and accepting my merge request that merges this theme to their repository.

Special thanks to [wackyideas](https://gitgud.io/wackyideas) for ATP and accepting my merge request that adds this theme to their repository.

Special thanks to [DuCanhGH](https://github.com/DuCanhGH) for better Windows 7 shadows.

This project is a fan-made labor of love that sees absolutely no profit whatsoever, donations or otherwise.

# Prerequisites

## Required Packages:
You need `plymouth`, (`plymouth-scripts` and `plymouth-plugin-script` may be required, depending on your distro). 
Optionally, you need `ImageMagick` for the Windows 7 variant.

*This section only covers distros that are available on AeroThemePlasma's installation guide.*
### Fedora: 
`sudo dnf install plymouth plymouth-scripts plymouth-plugin-script ImageMagick`
### Arch: 
`sudo pacman -S plymouth imagemagick`

## Required Fonts:

You need `Segoe UI` and `Lucida Console` from a Windows installation. These fonts must be installed as system-wide fonts.

These fonts are located on `C:\Windows\Fonts` in a Windows installation. You need `lucon.ttf` and `segoeui.ttf`. Make sure to copy these fonts from Windows 7 or Windows Vista for the best accuracy.

To install these fonts on your Linux machine,
- Create a new directory or select a directory on `/usr/share/fonts`.
- Copy `lucon.ttf` and `segoeui.ttf` to your selected created directory in `/usr/share/fonts`.
- Run `sudo fc-cache`.

## Systemd:
PlymouthVista uses systemd for the hibernation resume screen and the shutdown and reboot screen's fade effect.
If you are using something other than systemd and want to use these features, you need to make [these service files](./systemd).

# Installation & Configuration:

Clone this repository first by simply using `git clone https://github.com/rustussy/plymouth-vista`.

If you want to modify some of the text (e.g., show "Starting Linux" instead of "Starting Windows" on the Windows 7 boot screen or make your own [Windows 9 boot screen](https://crustywindo.ws/w/images/2/2a/Dilshad9-Boot.png)), please follow the [configuration guide](./CONFIG.md).

Also here are the available switches/arguments you can use on the install script:
- -h : Displays the help message.
- -s : Skips configuration-related questions, such as switching to Windows 7 mode.
- -u : Copies your older configuration.
- -n : Keeps your current Plymouth configuration by not applying PlymouthVista as the default Plymouth theme.
- -o : Overwrites if an existing installation exits. Only skips the overwrite question!
- -q : Skips the final question, which asks about whether you should use that configuration or not.

> [!WARNING]
> This theme is only tested on Fedora Linux and Arch Linux.

Or simply run this script if you don't care about the extra configuration.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rustussy/plymouth-vista
cd plymouth-vista
chmod +x ./compile.sh ; chmod +x ./install.sh
./compile.sh ; sudo ./install.sh
```

> [!WARNING]
> If you have issues such as flickering, [the wrong copyright symbol](https://github.com/furkrn/PlymouthVista/issues/7), etc.
> Consider one of these solutions, which can be used only with dracut:
> 1. Use the provided `omitPlymouth.sh` script, which omits the `plymouth` module **permanently**.
> 2. Use the `sudo dracut —force —regenerate-all —omit plymouth —verbose` command. **But this command must be run after each kernel update.**

# Uninstallation:
Simply run the provided `./uninstall.sh` script. Removes every configuration and service and reverts back to your old Plymouth theme.

This copy-paste script should help it:
```sh
chmod +x ./uninstall.sh ; sudo ./uninstall.sh
```
